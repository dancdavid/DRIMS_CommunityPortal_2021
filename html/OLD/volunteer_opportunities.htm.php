          <p><strong>Project Description: RECONSTRUCT OR REPAIR HOMES IN COASTAL BAYOU COMMUNITIES</strong><br>
              <strong>Narrative:</strong>
              <br>
              Through the partnerships of Terrebonne & Lafourche Recovery Coalition we have helped our communities repair & rebuild their storm damaged homes since 1992. Our Coastal Bayou Communities have been impacted by 8 Hurricanes (7major) since 1992. Many of these homes were impacted at least 5 - 6 times.  
              <br><br>
              TRAC will match volunteer groups to individual projects according to available skills. Groups with specialized skills such as electrical, plumbing, flooring, framing, siding, or any other specific construction skills are urgently needed. Please specify if someone is licensed in any of these fields. We need every skill from painting to framing.
              <br><br>
              TRAC will provide a field inspector and work site coordinator; however groups are encouraged to have at least two leaders that can take charge and manage a work site with given instruction. Building Materials will be available on worksite; all necessary permits will be pulled before your team’s arrival.  
              <br>
              <strong>Project Goals:</strong>
              <br>
              Our goal is to rebuild our bayou communities to survive the future physically, economically, mentally, spiritually and culturally through the unlimited possibilities of partnership.
